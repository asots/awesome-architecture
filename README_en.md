## Why this repo exists

For the past two decades, a programmer's core edge was **writing code correctly and fast**.

But something is happening right in front of us: **"writing code" is disappearing.** Not getting harder, not getting scarcer — *ending*, as a craft that humans do. At frontier labs like OpenAI and Anthropic, almost all code is already written by AI; human engineers no longer type out implementations by hand. They do just two things: **tell the AI what to build, then judge whether it got it right.** Once a machine spits out working code in seconds, knowing "`for` vs `map`, that API, this syntax" — the old craft — is worth nothing overnight.

What *isn't* depreciating — and is in fact getting more valuable — is a different skill:

> **Before you write the first line of code, figure out what the system should actually look like.**
>
> Where does data come from, where does it go? What must be strongly consistent, what can be eventual?
> Where will it break first? When users grow from 10K to 100M, what's the first bottleneck?
> To get A, which B am I willing to give up?

That is **architectural thinking**. It's independent of language, of framework, even of what's trendy this year. It's the judgment to **read the map before you hit the road**.

**Our belief: the great developer of the future is first a person who makes sound architectural judgments, and only second a person who writes code.** Understand what you're building at the architecture level first — code is just one way to make that understanding real.

### 📚 tutorial/ — Become a sharper architect

Not "how to use framework X", but a transferable way of thinking: how to turn a vague requirement into constraints, how to make decisions under trade-offs, how to draw architecture diagrams that actually communicate, and how to design a brand-new system from scratch.

### 🗺️ templates/ — Architecture maps of real systems

Each template is an "architecture map". We **deliberately avoid discussing language or framework** — only: what problem this class of system solves, what parts it's made of, how data flows, how the key trade-offs are made, and where it dies at scale.

**Classic / general systems**

## How to use this repo

**If you're a beginner / shifting toward architectural thinking:**
Read `tutorial/` in order. After each chapter, pick a system in `templates/` you find interesting and try to "read" it using the framework you just learned.

**If you're about to design a new system:**
Start with `tutorial/07` for the methodology, then find the map closest to your scenario in `templates/`. Treat it as a starting point, not an answer — walk through its "key decisions" and "common pitfalls" and ask yourself each one.

**If you're prepping for system design interviews:**
Every template covers high-frequency topics (overselling, feed fan-out, message ordering, streaming output…), all in a consistent format — great for systematic review.

**If you're a senior engineer / architect:**
Jump straight to each template's "Key Decisions & Trade-offs" and "Evolution Path" — the most concentrated parts. PRs sharing the scars you've earned are welcome.

## Three reading principles

1. **Ask "why" before "how".** Every architecture choice sits on top of a constraint or a trade-off. If you can't see the trade-off, you haven't understood it.
2. **There is no best architecture, only the most fitting one.** "Chat" for an internal tool and "chat" for WeChat are worlds apart. Scale, team, cost, and compliance decide everything.
3. **Architecture grows.** Don't force a mature-stage architecture onto an MVP. Every template includes an "evolution path" telling you when to upgrade — and when you're over-engineering.

## The one-sentence version

> **Code tells the computer what to do; architecture decides whether the thing is worth doing, can be done, and will hold up.**
> This repo trains you for the second kind of judgment.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome — new templates, fixes, and especially **English translations** of the tutorial and existing templates.

1. Copy [`templates/_TEMPLATE.md`](templates/_TEMPLATE.md) into a new folder, e.g. `templates/your-system/README.md`.
2. Fill in all 14 sections (including **real** reference-prototype links) and **stay strictly at the architecture level** — the moment you start writing "use library YY in language XX", stop and ask: is this an architecture decision, or an implementation detail?
3. Draw diagrams in ASCII (plain text, viewable everywhere, never breaks).
4. Add a row to the template list.

> The bar: an engineer who has never touched this domain can, after reading your template, explain "why this class of system is designed this way, and where it dies".
