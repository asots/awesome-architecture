  tagline: "Writing code is disappearing; judgment is what's getting valuable. 26 chapters on architectural thinking (foundations + advanced complete; practice track in progress; AI-collab planned) + 25 architecture maps of real systems — architecture only, no syntax."

    title: Judgment, not syntax
    details: No language or framework. A transferable, durable way of thinking — requirements → constraints → quality attributes → trade-offs.
  - icon: 🗺️
    title: 25 architecture maps
    details: From e-commerce, social feeds, chat and video to AI gateways, RAG and inference serving — each explains why it's built that way and where it breaks.
  - icon: ⚖️
    title: Decisions & trade-offs first
    details: Every template lists the real forks in the road, what was given up, and the first bottleneck at scale.
  - icon: 🔗
    title: Real prototypes
    details: Each template links to real open-source projects and engineering papers (vLLM, LiteLLM, TigerBeetle, Uber H3, Figma…).

## ⚖️ Architecture is a series of forks in the road

The most valuable section of every template is "Key Decisions & Trade-offs." Try this interactive starter:

<DecisionCard
  title="Monolith or Microservices?"
  a="Monolith"
  aDesc="One deployable unit, in-process function calls. Simple, debuggable, light on ops."
  b="Microservices"
  bDesc="Multiple independently deployed services calling each other over the network. Independent scaling and release, but you inherit the full burden of distributed systems."
  verdict="Default to a 'modular monolith' first. Microservices first solve a *people* scaling problem (multiple teams blocking each other in one codebase), not a *machine* performance problem — splitting prematurely, without the org size, independent-deployment need, and platform muscle in place, is self-inflicted pain."
/>

## 🤔 First, a warm-up

Before diving in, check your gut sense of 'architecture':

<Quiz
  question="Which of the following is closest to the essence of 'architecture'?"
  :options="['A diagram with a few boxes connected by lines', 'A set of decisions that are hard to change, cross-cutting, and decide quality attributes', 'Just use the newest frameworks and microservices']"
  :answer="1"
  explanation="Architecture = the decisions that, once made, are hard to change, affect the whole system, and decide whether it is *good*. Diagrams are how decisions get expressed; the *why* behind decisions is the soul."
/>
